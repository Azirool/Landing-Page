# Landing Page

A landing page project created as a personal challenge to push the limits of web development.

## Overview

This landing page project was undertaken as a self-imposed challenge to enhance my web development skills. The design concept for this project was sourced from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io), a platform that provides web development challenges to foster professional growth.

## Features

- **Dynamic Theming:** The project showcases a dynamic theming feature, empowering users to effortlessly switch between light and dark modes for an improved reading experience. Dark mode is especially beneficial in low-light environments, reducing eye strain and providing a sleek alternative to the default light mode.

- **Technologies Utilized:** The project leverages [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for streamlined styling and incorporates a touch of JavaScript to provide interactive functionality.
